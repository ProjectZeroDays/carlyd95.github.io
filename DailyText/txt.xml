Do not bring us into temptation.<wbr />—</em><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102017006/53/0" data-bid="54-1" class="b"><em>Matt. 6:13</em></a><em>.</em></p> <div class="bodyTxt"> <div id="section1" class="section"> <div class="pGroup"> <p id="p43" data-pid="43" class="sb">Considering what happened to Jesus shortly after his baptism can help us to understand the need for the request: “Do not bring us into temptation.” Jesus was led into the wilderness by God’s spirit. Why? “To be tempted by the Devil.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102017006/54/0" data-bid="55-1" class="b">Matt. 4:1</a>) Should that surprise us? Not if we grasp the main reason why God sent his Son to the earth. That was to settle the issue raised when Adam and Eve rejected God’s sovereignty. Questions needed time to be settled. For example, was something wrong with the way God created man? Was it possible for a perfect human to uphold God’s sovereignty regardless of pressures from “the wicked one”? And would mankind be better off independent of God’s rulership, as Satan implied? (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102017006/55/0" data-bid="56-1" class="b">Gen. 3:4, 5</a>) Answering such questions would require time but would show all intelligent creation that Jehovah exercises his sovereignty in a beneficial way. <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/pc/r1/lp-e/1102017006/13/0"><em>w15 </em>6/15 5:12
