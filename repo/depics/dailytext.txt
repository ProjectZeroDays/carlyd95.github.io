Â Â Daily Text Script
Description
	â€¢	This package is a simple command line tool that fetches the Daily Text at 5:30 AM each morning from JW.org then saves it to /Library/DailyText/DailyText.txt. simply type dailytext -alert to display the text! â€¨â€¨â€¨I also recommend downloading QuickActivator and the JW.org Glyph for it and set up an activator listener to run dailytext -alert so you can quickly get the daily text from your control center. This is shown in the video belowâ€¨
