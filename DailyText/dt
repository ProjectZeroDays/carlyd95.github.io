Still, we know that an individual living in David’s day who showed consideration to a lowly one did not keep living without end. Hence, when David wrote the above, he could not have meant that such a considerate individual would be kept alive miraculously, thus gaining everlasting life. We can take those inspired words to mean that God would help the loyal considerate one. How? David explained: “Jehovah will sustain him on his sickbed; during his sickness you will completely change his bed.” (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102017006/105/0" data-bid="106-1" class="b">Ps. 41:3</a>) Yes, an individual who showed consideration to a lowly one could be certain that God was aware of him and his faithful course. And the recuperative power of his God-given body might help him to get better, to recover from his sickness. <a href="/en/wol/pc/r1/lp-e/1102017006/31/0"><em>w15 </em>12/15 4:7</a></p><br><br><p><small><FONT COLOR=#c8c8c8>(unsubscribe link  available through carlyd95.github.io.)</FONT></body></center></html>
