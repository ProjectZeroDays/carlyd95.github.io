<p id="p51" data-pid="51" class = "themeScrp"><em>He was merciful; he would forgive their error and not bring them to ruin. He often held back his anger instead of stirring up all his wrath.<wbr />—</em><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102017006/65/0" data-bid="66-1" class="b"><em>Ps. 78:38</em></a><em>.</em></p>

<p id="p52" data-pid="52" class="sb">Reflecting on that verse may help you to appreciate in a very personal way that Jehovah loves and cares for you. Be assured that you do matter to Jehovah. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102017006/66/0" data-bid="67-1" class="b">1 Pet. 5:6, 7</a>) We should value the Bible highly because God communicates with us primarily by means of it. Meaningful and compassionate communication between parents and their children is essential to building mutual trust and developing a feeling of being loved. What can we expect of Jehovah? Although we have never seen him or heard his voice, he “speaks” to us through his inspired Word, and we need to listen. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102017006/67/0" data-bid="68-1" class="b">Isa. 30:20, 21</a>) Jehovah desires to guide us, his dedicated people, and to protect us from harm. He also wants us to know him and to put our trust in him.<wbr />—<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102017006/68/0" data-bid="69-1" class="b">Ps. 19:7-11;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102017006/68/1" data-bid="69-2" class="b"> Prov. 1:33</a>. <a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/pc/r1/lp-e/1102017006/16/0"><em>w15 </em>8/15 1:6, 7</a></p>
