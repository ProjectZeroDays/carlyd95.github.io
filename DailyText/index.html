(<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102017006/88/0" data-bid="89-1" class="b">Heb. 6:1, 2</a>) Take note of fulfilled prophecies in the Bible because these can provide you with powerful reasons for having faith. You can also use Gods Word as a measuring rod to see if your faith matches the description of what is expected of those who have strong faith. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102017006/89/0" data-bid="90-1" class="b">Jas. 1:25;</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102017006/89/1" data-bid="90-2" class="b"> 2:24,</a><a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102017006/89/2" data-bid="90-3" class="b"> 26</a>) The apostle Paul told fellow Christians that they could have an interchange of encouragement by one anothers faith. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102017006/90/0" data-bid="91-1" class="b">Rom. 1:12</a>) As we associate with fellow worshippers, we can build up one anothers faith, especially when we are with those who have already demonstrated the tested quality of their faith. (<a href="https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102017006/91/0" data-bid="92-1" class="b">Jas. 1:3</a>) Bad associations destroy faith, but good associations build it.
