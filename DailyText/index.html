Once in the days of Samuel, Israel was badly defeated in battle by the Philistines. Gods people were in dire need of help and protection. What did they do? Let us take the ark of Jehovahs covenant with us from Shiloh, so that it may be with us and save us from the hand of our enemies, they decided. The outcome? The slaughter was very great; on Israels side, 30,000 foot soldiers fell. Moreover, the Ark of God was captured.
