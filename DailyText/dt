That verse used to read: “There is no work nor devising nor knowledge nor wisdom in Sheʹol, the place to which you are going.” Translators of many non-English editions faced this problem: The term “Sheol” is unknown to most of their readers, it is not found in their dictionaries, and it sounds like some geographic location. Accordingly, for the 2013 revision, approval was given to make the meaning of “Sheol” and the corresponding Greek term “Hades” clear by translating them accurately as “the Grave.” Obsolete English expressions were also replaced, and a concerted effort was put forth to make the text clear and easy to understand without sacrificing accuracy. Applying what had been done in other languages sharpened the English text. <a href="/en/wol/pc/r1/lp-e/1102017006/29/0"><em>w15 </em>12/15 2:10,</a><a href="/en/wol/pc/r1/lp-e/1102017006/30/0"> 12</a></p><br><br><p><small><FONT COLOR=#c8c8c8>(unsubscribe link  available through carlyd95.github.io.)</FONT></body></center></html>
