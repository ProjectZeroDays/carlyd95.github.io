We would not ask them personal questions about their anointing. We thus avoid meddling with what does not concern us.

Genetics or marriage play no part in the process.

Rather than raise questions that may cause pain, all of us can have full confidence that Jehovah will open his hand and “satisfy the desire of every living thing.” (<a href="/https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102017006/118/0" data-bid="119-1" class="b">Ps. 145:16</a>) Those who treat anointed Christians in a proper manner protect themselves from an insidious danger<wbr />—“false brothers” who claim to be anointed.<wbr />—<a href="/https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102017006/119/0" data-bid="120-1" class="b">Gal. 2:4, 5;</a><a href="/https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/bc/r1/lp-e/1102017006/119/1" data-bid="120-2" class="b"> 1 John 2:19</a>. <a href="/https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/pc/r1/lp-e/1102017006/34/0"><em>w16.01 </em>4:10, 11</a></p><br><p><small><FONT COLOR=#c8c8c8>(unsubscribe link  available through carlyd95.github.io.)</FONT></body></center></html>
